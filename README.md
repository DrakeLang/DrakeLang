# DrakeLang

A universal, C# inspired language made with intent to support transpilation to a range of other languages/runtimes, like C#/.NET, Java, JS (and maybe even *Windows Batch*, so no one has to experience writing that manually ever again).

Current layout is heavily inspired by compiler project https://github.com/terrajobst/minsk by [@terrajobst](https://twitter.com/terrajobst).
